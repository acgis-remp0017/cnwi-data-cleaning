    <p>The Newfoundland data consists of seven shapefiles and one Excel
spreadsheet. The data was collected in 2005 at various sites on
the Avalon Peninsula (St John’s area).</p>

<h2 id="challenges-encountered">Challenges encountered</h2>
<p>The main challenge with this dataset was that these
shapefiles had some duplicate data between them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some points, as identified by geometry or by the ‘Site’
attribute, were found in multiple shapefiles; other in only
one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attributes were mostly consistent: if the ‘Date’ attribute
for a certain point was ‘2005-08-10’, for example, in one
shapefile, it was the same in the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, some attributes were inconsistent. In
particular, the ‘Class’ and ‘Comment’ attributes sometimes had
different values in different files for the same point.</p>
<p>In the case of the class attribute, some of the inconsistency
may be attributed to using a finer-grained classification
system when collecting the data and using a coarser-grained
system when using the data to validate a classified image. For
example, there are a couple of cases where one shapefile
classified a point as ‘Poor Fen’ and another classifies the
same point as ‘Fen’; here and in similar cases, it seems
likely to me that the point is really ‘Poor Fen’, but they
reclassified it as ‘Fen’ for the accuracy assessment (which
indeed does not distinguish among subclasses of fen). On the
other hand, when one point is classified as both ‘Upland’ and
‘Swamp’, this seems to be an irreconcilable inconsistency.</p>
<p>The ‘Comment’ attribute was peculiar in that in many cases it
said something contradictory to the ‘Class’ attribute – e.g.
saying a point is a bog when it is classed as fen.
Furthermore, there was an Excel spreadsheet that, although
otherwise useful, had a ‘Comment’ column that was even more
scrambled in respect of its correspondence with the other
columns than the shapefiles. On the whole I did not trust the
‘Comment’ field. Thankfully vegetation notes that were much
more consistent with themselves and with the rest of the data were present in the
‘Veg2’ field in multiple files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report accompanying the data said that they collected 89
field points and that they found 57 of them usable for
training/validation of their classification; the others, they
said, could not be classified definitively or represented too
small an area.</p>
<p>The obvious approach was to identify which
points were the 57 that they found to be good quality and use
those. Unfortunately, I could not identify which of the 107
total points those were – nor even which were the 89 points
they actually visited! Some points did have an attribute
explicitly marking them as having been visited; some had date
and time attributes; but when I counted these subsets of
points, they didn’t add up to 89.</p>
<p>The confusion matrices in the report should have been helpful,
as they broke down the points by class, but I still couldn’t
identify exactly which points they were referring to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the
end I simply extracted all points whose classification was
unanimous or trivially reconciled and which were explicitly
marked as ‘visited’. Subtracting those classed as ‘not
wetland’, this yielded 41 points of the original 107; these are
depicted in the map above, along with the points that could not
be used in a ghostly colour.</p>

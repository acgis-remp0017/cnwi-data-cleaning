    <p>The Newfoundland data consists of seven shapefiles and one Excel
spreadsheet. The data was collected in 2005 at various sites on
the Avalon Peninsula (St John’s area).</p>

<p>The main challenge with this dataset was that these
shapefiles had some duplicate data between them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some points, as identified by geometry or by the ‘Site’
attribute, were found in multiple shapefiles; other in only
one.</li>
<li>The attributes were mostly consistent: if the ‘Date’ attribute
for a certain point was ‘2005-08-10’, for example, in one
shapefile, it was the same in the others.</li>
<li>On the other hand, some attributes were inconsistent. In
particular, the ‘Class’ and ‘Comment’ attributes sometimes had
different values in different files for the same point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The inconsistency with the ‘Class’ attribute was the real
problem. In the end, several points could not be used because of
this ambiguity.</p>
<p>After combining the information from the various source files
and filtering out points with inconsistent or incomplete
attributes, 41 of the original 107 points remained; these are
depicted in the map above, along with the points that could not
be used in a ghostly colour.</p>

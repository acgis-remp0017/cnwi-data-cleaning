    <p>The Newfoundland data consists of seven shapefiles and one Excel
spreadsheet. The data was collected in 2005 at various sites on
the Avalon Peninsula (St John’s area).</p>

<h2 id="challenges-encountered">Challenges encountered</h2>
<p>The main challenge with this dataset was that these
shapefiles had some duplicate data between them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some points, as identified by geometry or by the ‘Site’
attribute, were found in multiple shapefiles; other in only
one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attributes were mostly consistent: if the ‘Date’ attribute
for a certain point was ‘2005-08-10’, for example, in one
shapefile, it was the same in the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, some attributes were inconsistent. In
particular, the ‘Class’ and ‘Comment’ attributes sometimes had
different values in different files for the same point.</p>
<p>In the case of the class attribute, some of the inconsistency
may be attributed to using a finer-grained classification
system when collecting the data and using a coarser-grained
system when using the data to validate a classified image.</p>
<p>The ‘Comment’ attribute was peculiar in that in many cases it
said something contradictory to the ‘Class’ attribute – e.g.
saying a point is a bog when it is classed as fen.
On the whole I did not trust the
‘Comment’ field. Thankfully vegetation notes that were much
more consistent with themselves and with the rest of the data were present in the
‘Veg2’ field in multiple files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report accompanying the data said that they collected 89
field points and that they found 57 of them usable for
training/validation of their classification; the others, they
said, could not be classified definitively or represented too
small an area.</p>
<p>The obvious approach was to identify which
points were the 57 that they found to be good quality and use
those. Unfortunately, I could not identify which of the 107
total points those were – nor even which were the 89 points
they actually visited!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the
end I simply extracted all points whose classification was
unanimous or trivially reconciled and which were explicitly
marked as ‘visited’. Subtracting those classed as ‘not
wetland’, this yielded 41 points of the original 107; these are
depicted in the map above, along with the points that could not
be used in a ghostly colour.</p>

In general, my workflow followed these major steps:

1. Identify and locate the data to be cleaned. (This wasn't
   always straightforward &ndash; the Labrador folder structure
   in particular was a bit complicated.)
2. Check if it has a (sensible) spatial reference. Display it on
   a map in ArcGIS Pro; see if it shows up in the expected
   location.
3. Check for any oddities or inconsistencies in the geometry or
   attributes. Flag any features that appear dodgy, possibly
   omitting them from the final database.
4. Select those features that have a wetland class attribute
   that can be mapped onto the
   <abbr title="Canadian National Wetlands Inventory">CNWI</abbr>
   classification system; crosswalk them into the CNWI system.

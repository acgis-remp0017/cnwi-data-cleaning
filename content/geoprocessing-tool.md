I also developed a simple geoprocessing tool to assist me in my
work. It compares two tables and shows the differences between
them in the form of a new table. This is the sort of thing I did
a lot when inspecting the Newfoundland data, in particular.

This tool is more or less an improved version of a built-in tool
called Table Compare, which purports to do basically the same
thing but turned out to be useless for my purposes.

This tool that I created is included in the project deliverables
in the hope that it may assist those who undertake similar data
cleaning projects in the future.

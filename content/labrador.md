The Labrador data came from three different field expeditions,
in 1993, 2004, and 2005. The 2004 and 2005 data originally had
polygon geometry, but I have depicted all the features here as
points so that they may be more easily discerned at this scale.

In this case the data was not so complicated as with
Newfoundland. It was easy to
determine that I had all the ground-truth data mentioned in the
reports that accompanied these datasets.

In total, these datasets yielded 116 classified points out of
131 total (that is, leaving out those with no class or
classified as 'not wetland').

The Labrador data came from three different field expeditions,
in 1993, 2004, and 2005, in the Minipi Lake and Lake Melville regions. The 2004 and 2005 data has
polygon geometry, but I have depicted all the features here as
points so that they may be more easily discerned at this scale.

This data caused me a number of perplexities: different coordinate systems for the same data, survey sites present in both point and polygon geometry, and many 1993 points with positional errors, not all of which could be corrected definitively.

In total, these datasets yielded 73 classified points out of
131 total. I did not crosswalk points with no class, that were classified as
'not wetland', and those whose positional accuracy could not be confirmed.

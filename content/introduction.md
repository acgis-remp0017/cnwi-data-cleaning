The goal of my project was to clean up some data about wetlands
that was collected 18-30 years ago
so that it can be added to the Canadian National Wetlands
Inventory (CNWI).

The datasets were collected on several field surveys in
Newfoundland and Labrador that took place in 1993,
2004, and 2005. The purpose of this data was to serve as ground
truth data for two projects that aimed to classify wetlands from
satellite imagery. Reports on both these classification projects
came along with the field data; these reports have been very
helpful to me, as they provided important context and gave some
clues about what field data to look for.

This data is quite valuable to the Canadian Wildlife Service. It was and is costly to undertake a field expedition like the ones that these datasets came from, so it is desirable to make as much use of this field data as possible. Moreover, historical data like this cannot be replaced, because the landscapes that were visited have likely changed in the meantime. In the case of the Newfoundland project, part of the larger purpose was to be able to see how wetlands were being affected by encroaching suburbs in the vicinity of St John’s.

## Deliverables

* A file geodatabase with feature classes containing the cleaned
  data, set up according to the <abbr title="Canadian National
  Wetlands Inventory">CNWI</abbr> schema
* An ArcGIS Pro project with maps that provide overviews of the
  areas of interest
* A report describing the processes I used and challenges I came
  across
* A geoprocessing tool that I created to help me in my work
* Any images I found alongside the data that were of sufficient
  quality to be useful in the future
